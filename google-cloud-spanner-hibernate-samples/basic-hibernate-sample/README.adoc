= Cloud Spanner Hibernate Example

This sample application demonstrates the basics of using https://hibernate.org/[Hibernate] with https://cloud.google.com/spanner/[Google Cloud Spanner].

See https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-spanner-hibernate/tree/master/google-cloud-spanner-hibernate-samples/spring-data-jpa-full-sample[this Cloud Spanner Spring Data JPA with Hibernate Sample]
for a sample application that shows all available Spanner features that can be used with Hibernate.

== Setup & Configuration
1. Create a Google Cloud Platform Project
2. https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started#creating_the_service_account[Create a service account] with Cloud Spanner permission.
Furnish a new JSON key and then set the credentials using the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.
+
Alternatively, have the https://cloud.google.com/sdk/[Google Cloud SDK] installed and initialized and logged in with https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials[application default credentials].

3. Enable the https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/spanner.googleapis.com/overview[Cloud Spanner API]

4. Create a Cloud Spanner instance and database in your project and save those details for the next step.

== Run the Example
Run the example `main` method in `SampleApplication.java` while providing the connection details.

----
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.SampleApplication" -Dhibernate.connection.url="jdbc:cloudspanner:/projects/{YOUR_PROJECT_ID}/instances/{YOUR_INSTANCE_ID}/databases/{YOUR_DATABASE_ID}"
----

This example opens a transaction and saves a `Person` entity without specifying its `UUID`.
It also saves an associated `Payment` record for the person.

This insert query will appear in the application output:
----
Hibernate: insert into Payment (amount, id) values (?, ?)
Hibernate: insert into WireTransferPayment (wireId, id) values (?, ?)
Hibernate: insert into PersonsTable (address, name, nickname, payment_id, id) values (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
----

The saved entities are then retrieved using an HQL query, and the stored person with the generated ID is printed:
----
Hibernate: select person0_.id as id1_0_, person0_.address as address2_0_, person0_.name as name3_0_, person0_.nickname as nickname4_0_ from PersonsTable person0_

There are 1 persons saved in the table:
Person{
 id=688377a3-b884-4beb-886d-6e93317c5542
 name='person'
 nickname='purson'
 address='address'
 payment_amount=200
}
----

You will also be able to view the tables and data that Hibernate created in Spanner through the https://console.cloud.google.com/spanner[Google Cloud Platform Console].

== Interleaved Tables Example

This application also demonstrates an `Interleaved` table relationship in Spanner through the `Singer` and `Album` entities.

Cloud Spanner offers the concept of https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/schema-and-data-model#creating-interleaved-tables[Interleaved Tables] which allows you to co-locate the rows of an interleaved table with rows of a parent table for efficient retrieval.

Using the `@Interleaved` annotation, the sample declares `Album` to be an interleaved table within `Singer`.
We also must use a composite primary key `AlbumId` to express that the Album inherits all of the primary key fields of the parent:

[source, java]
----
@Entity
@Interleaved(parentEntity = Singer.class, cascadeDelete = true)
@IdClass(AlbumId.class)
public class Album {

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
  @Type(type = "uuid-char")
  private UUID albumId;

  @Id
  @ManyToOne
  @JoinColumn(name = "singerId")
  @Type(type = "uuid-char")
  private Singer singer;

  public static class AlbumId implements Serializable {

    // The primary key columns of the parent entity
    // must be declared first.
    Singer singer;

    @Type(type = "uuid-char")
    UUID albumId;

    // Getters and setters
  }
}
----

If you need to create a link from `Album` to `Singer`, we can declare it as a `@ManyToOne` relationship and we must specify the primary key fields to inherit from `Singer` through the `@JoinColumn` annotation.
In this case `singerId` is the column to inherit.

[source, java]
----
@Id
@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "singerId")
@Type(type = "uuid-char")
private Singer singer;
----

In addition, we may specify a `@OneToMany` link from `Singer` to `Album` in the entity by using the `mappedBy` setting in the `@OneToMany` annotation.

[source, java]
----
@Entity
public class Singer {

  @OneToMany(mappedBy = "singer")
  List<Album> albums;

  // continued...
}
----

After running the sample, you will also see some sample `Singer` and `Album` records be created.

----
Hibernate: insert into Singer (name, singerId) values (?, ?)
Hibernate: insert into Album (title, albumId, singerId) values (?, ?, ?)
Hibernate: select singer0_.singerId as singerId1_5_, singer0_.name as name2_5_ from Singer singer0_
There are 1 singers saved in the table:
Singer{singerId=b8766052-ed24-4f18-9853-ed48ecc19c14
, albums=[Album{albumId=22badab3-9ac0-4b70-a159-213e5342d9b0, singer=Singer1, title='Album name'}]
, name='Singer1'
}
