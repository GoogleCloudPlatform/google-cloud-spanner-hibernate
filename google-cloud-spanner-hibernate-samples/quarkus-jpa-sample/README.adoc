= Cloud Spanner Quarkus JPA and Panache with Hibernate Sample

See https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-spanner-hibernate/tree/master/google-cloud-spanner-hibernate-samples/spring-data-jpa-full-sample[this Cloud Spanner Spring Data JPA with Hibernate Sample]
for a sample application that shows all available Spanner features that can be used with Hibernate.

WARNING: This sample temporarily does not work; it hangs when trying to acquire Spanner sessions. See https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-spanner-hibernate/issues/373 for context.

This sample application demonstrates using https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus] with https://quarkus.io/guides/hibernate-orm[JPA], https://quarkus.io/guides/hibernate-orm-panache[Panache] and https://cloud.google.com/spanner/[Google Cloud Spanner].

This sample is only tested with Quarkus in JVM mode. Native mode is not tested/supported.

== Setup & Configuration
1. Create a Google Cloud Platform project.
2. https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started#creating_the_service_account[Create a service account] with Cloud Spanner permission.
Furnish a new JSON key and then set the credentials using the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.
+
Alternatively, have the https://cloud.google.com/sdk/[Google Cloud SDK] installed and initialized and logged in with https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials[application default credentials].

3. Enable the https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/spanner.googleapis.com/overview[Cloud Spanner API].

4. In the http://console.cloud.google.com/spanner[Spanner Cloud Console UI], create a Cloud Spanner instance and database and insert those details into the `quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url` defined in the file `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
This setting configures the connection URL which specifies the database that your application will connect to.
+
----
# Spanner connection URL.
# - ${PROJECT_ID} Replace with your GCP project ID
# - ${INSTANCE_ID} Replace with your Spanner instance ID
# - ${DATABASE_NAME} Replace with the name of your Spanner database that you created inside your Spanner instance

quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:cloudspanner:/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/instances/${INSTANCE_ID}/databases/${DATABASE_NAME}
----

5. Open a terminal instance inside this directory and run `mvn compile quarkus:dev` to start the app.
+
In the `application.properties` file, you'll see that the application is running with `quarkus.hibernate-orm.database.generation=update` which allows Hibernate to create tables for you if they do not exist.
On the very first time you run the app, Hibernate will automatically create the schema and missing tables based on the `@Entity` definitions.

6. Post a data entry with curl: `curl -XPOST -d'{"name": "Ray"}' -H"Content-Type: application/json"  http://localhost:8080/person`
+
You can view the data that was populated in your Cloud Spanner database by navigating to your database in the http://console.cloud.google.com/spanner[Spanner Console] view.
