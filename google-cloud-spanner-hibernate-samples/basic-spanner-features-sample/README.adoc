= Cloud Spanner Features Example

This sample application demonstrates using https://hibernate.org/[Hibernate] with https://cloud.google.com/spanner/[Google Cloud Spanner].

It provides examples of how to access the Spanner JDBC Driver to perform stale reads, read-only transactions, and other Spanner-specific operations from Hibernate.

== Setup & Configuration
1. Create a Google Cloud Platform Project
2. https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started#creating_the_service_account[Create a service account] with Cloud Spanner permission.
Furnish a new JSON key and then set the credentials using the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.
+
Alternatively, have the https://cloud.google.com/sdk/[Google Cloud SDK] installed and initialized and logged in with https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials[application default credentials].

3. Enable the https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/spanner.googleapis.com/overview[Cloud Spanner API].

4. Create a Cloud Spanner instance and database in your project and save those details for the next step.

== Run the Examples

First construct the JDBC URL string based on the Spanner instance and database you created.

Replace the `PROJECT_ID`, `INSTANCE_ID`, and `DATABASE_ID` parameters in the command to specify the Spanner database you will use for the samples.
```
jdbc:cloudspanner:/projects/{YOUR_PROJECT_ID}/instances/{YOUR_INSTANCE_ID}/databases/{YOUR_DATABASE_ID}
```

=== Stale Read Sample

Stale reads are a feature in Cloud Spanner which allows you to read records from the database https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/reads#read_types[at a previous point in time].

The `StaleReadsDemo.java` provides a demonstration of how to perform a Stale read in Hibernate.
The sample creates a new row in the database which is successfully read by a strong-read, but is not present in the stale read.

To run the sample on command line:

----
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.StaleReadsDemo" -Dhibernate.connection.url="jdbc:cloudspanner:/projects/{YOUR_PROJECT_ID}/instances/{YOUR_INSTANCE_ID}/databases/{YOUR_DATABASE_ID}"
----

=== Read-Only Transactions

Spanner offers https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/transactions#read-only_transactions[read-only transactions] which can offer performance benefits for read-only queries.

The `TransactionTypeDemo.java` offers an example of how to perform a read-only transaction.

To run the sample on command line:

----
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.TransactionTypeDemo" -Dhibernate.connection.url="jdbc:cloudspanner:/projects/{YOUR_PROJECT_ID}/instances/{YOUR_INSTANCE_ID}/databases/{YOUR_DATABASE_ID}"
----

== Best Practices

Many advanced features of Cloud Spanner can be accessed through the JDBC Driver by unwrapping the underlying JDBC connection from the session:

```
session.doWork(conn -> {
  conn.setReadOnly(false);
  conn.createStatement().execute("SET READ_ONLY_STALENESS = 'STRONG'");
});
```

NOTE: It is important to remember that JDBC Connections are pooled and **shared** among Hibernate sessions. If you modify a JDBC connection in one session (such as setting it to read-only), that change will affect the next session using the connection. Therefore, it is recommended to wrap session creation in a helper class (such as link:src/main/java/com/example/SessionHelper.java[`SessionHelper.java`] in this sample) to help manage JDBC driver settings.
